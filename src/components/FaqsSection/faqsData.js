        content: "A root canal isn't typically painful. Local anesthesia numbs the area, so you shouldn't feel discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, you might have mild soreness or sensitivity, but this is easily managed with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Root canals are meant to relieve pain, not cause it."
