        content: "A well-performed root canal treatment, combined with proper oral care, can last many years. After the damaged pulp tissue and bacteria are removed, the treated tooth becomes free of infection, allowing the tooth to remain functional. However, it's essential to maintain good oral hygiene, including regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings, to ensure the long-term success of the root canal treatment."

        iconSrc: "src/assets/resu-neal.png",
        content: "A root canal isn't typically painful. Local anesthesia numbs the area, so you shouldn't feel discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, you might have mild soreness or sensitivity, but this is easily managed with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Root canals are meant to relieve pain, not cause it."
