        content: "A well-performed root canal treatment, combined with proper oral care, can last many years. After the damaged pulp tissue and bacteria are removed, the treated tooth becomes free of infection, allowing the tooth to remain functional. However, it's essential to maintain good oral hygiene, including regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings, to ensure the long-term success of the root canal treatment."

        iconSrc: "src/assets/resu-neal.png",
        content: "A root canal procedure is typically performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area and helps minimize discomfort. During the procedure, you shouldn't feel any pain. However, it's common to experience mild soreness or sensitivity in the days following the treatment. This mild discomfort is usually easily managed with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen."

        content: "Most root canals can be completed in approximately 1 hour. However, depending on the complexity of the tooth, it may take more or less time. Some teeth require two visits, but most are completed in one visit."

If we are not in-network with your plan, the percentage that insurance pays for out-of-network treatment is oftentimes the same as for in-network, so don't hesitate to schedule with us, even if we are not in-network with your insurance. We will do everything possible to maximize your benefits."

After root canal therapy is performed on the tooth, you may need to return to your dentist for a permanent restoration or a crown. However, if you donâ€™t have a referral or have been referred to a different endodontic practice, you can schedule an appointment directly with our practice. We can request dental records from your dentist before you are seen in our office."
